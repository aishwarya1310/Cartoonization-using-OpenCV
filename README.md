# Cartoonization-using-OpenCV

Cartoonization of image is implemented using OpenCV library and numpy library. Python language is used. Also, bilateral filtering is applied as it helps to smooth an image and reduce noise while preserving the edges. Edge detection method, median blur and adaptive threshold method are also implemented.
